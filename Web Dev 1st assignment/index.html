            I am a <strong>detail-oriented Project Manager and Business Development professional</strong> currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology with a major in Project Management at Westcliff University through King's College Nepal (GPA: 3.92).
        </p>
        <p class="p">Currently working as a <strong>Business Development Trainee at Ncell</strong>, I develop new business leads and opportunities by identifying and engaging with prospective corporate clients in the Nepalese telecom market. I've successfully coordinated with sales, marketing, and product teams to strategize pitches, increasing conversion rates for enterprise service offerings.</p>
        <p class="p">Previously, I served as an <strong>Associate Project Manager at Symbiosis Solutions</strong>, where I led teams of developers through multiple IT projects, and as <strong>Creative Manager at King's Club</strong>, where I managed a creative team of 5 and oversaw video content production and social media strategy.</p>
        <p class="p">My experience spans project management, quality assurance, creative design, and event coordination. I've worked on brand guideline designs for companies like Lovsy Candies and Himalayan Cardamom, and even contributed to the logo design team for the Nepal Investment Summit 2024 in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
